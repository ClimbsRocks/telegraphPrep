//Today we're going to get in a bunch of practice with objects. 
//As you start your JS journey, there's a ton of value in just building out the muscle memory for the fundamentals. 
//To get these fundamentals as deeply embedded as possible, type them out new each time. Avoid copying code, as you're just ignoring a chance to get in more useful practice. 

// 1. To start, let's create a variable, mysticalAnimal, and set it equal to an object literal. 

// Dot Notation:
// Recall that dot notation takes whatever is to the right of the dot, turns it into a string, and looks up that string as a property name in the object to the left of the dot. 
// Let's use dot notation to add some properties to mysticalAnimal.
// 2. Add a type property, and set it equal to 'dragon'.
// 3. Add a name property, and set it equal to 'Larry'.
// 4. Add a likes property, and set it equal to an empty array.
// 5. Add a property called bestFriend, and set it equal to your name. 
// 6. Add in a superPower property. Set it equal to 'gives amazing hugs'.

// Bracket notation:
// Recall that we can do two different things with bracket notation:
  // A. Evaluate a variable or expression, and look up what that variable evalutates to as a property name in the object.
  // B. Pass in a string (as noted by the quotes surrounding it) and look up that string as a property name in the object. 
// Remember that bracket notation is the ONLY way to look up variables or expressions when using them with objects. 

// 7. Create a variable called thisIsAVariable. Set it equal to the string 'superPower'.
// Now let's use this to play with bracket vs. dot notation. 
// 8.
