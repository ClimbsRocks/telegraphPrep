// Arrays!

// Arrays are great places to store lists of similar information.
// Where objects have property names to denote the different slots you can store data in, arrays have numbered indices. 

// 0-indexed
// array.length
// push
// pop
// unshift
// shift
// numerically indexed
// accessing using variables
// create an array of mysticalAnimals called grandCouncil
// you access data from an array by just asking for the value stored at a certain numbered position. 

// Arrays are 0-indexed. That is, the first thing that you put in there will go in at index 0. So if you have 3 things in your array, they will be at arr[0], arr[1], and arr[2]. 

// 1. Create an empty array called treasureChest. We're going to fill it with all the things that our dragon from yesterday has hoarded over the years. 
// 2. Let's make the value at position 0 'fur jackets'. 
// Suddenly, our dragon is either A) attacked by PETA for having animal fur jackets, or B) decides to move somewhere warm. Either way, she's no longer in need of fur jackets. 
// 3. Overwrite the value stored at position 0 to be 'ethically sourced sandals'. 
// 4.
